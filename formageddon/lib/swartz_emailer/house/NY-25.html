<p>Thank you for contacting me.  I'm always eager to hear from Americans across our country regarding the most pressing issue of our time.  Unfortunately, the Rules of Congressional Courtesy requires that individuals residing outside of the 25th Congressional District be referred to the Member of Congress who represents them.  According to the zip code you have entered, you reside outside of the 25th District. </p>

<p>To verify your Congressional district, search the Member of Congress directory at http://www.house.gov.  Or if you believe you are receiving this message in error, please call my office at 202-225-3615 or 585-232-4850. </p>

<p>Sincerely, <br />
Louise</p>
